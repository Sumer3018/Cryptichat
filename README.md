StegaCrypt Chat
A secure, real-time messaging application featuring a unique hybrid security model of end-to-end encryption and steganography.

StegaCrypt Chat is a full-stack web application designed for users who prioritize privacy and security in their communications. It goes beyond standard messaging apps by implementing a dual-layered security approach: all text messages are end-to-end encrypted, and users also have the ability to conceal their encrypted messages within the data of an image file (steganography), making the communication itself difficult to detect.

The application is built with a modern tech stack, leveraging the power of React for the frontend and Supabase for a scalable, real-time backend.

‚ú® Features
- Real-Time Messaging: Instant message delivery for one-on-one and group conversations.
- Hybrid Security Model:
- End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): All standard text messages are encrypted on -the client-side, ensuring only the sender and recipient can read them.
- Steganography: A unique feature to hide encrypted text within a cover image, providing an extra layer of deniability and security.
- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login handled by Supabase Auth.
- Chat Management: Create new one-on-one chats or multi-user groups.
- Creator-Only Controls: Only the user who created a chat can delete it, enforced by PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS).
- Bulk Message Deletion: Users can select multiple messages they've sent and delete them in a single action.
- User Search: Find and start conversations with other registered users.
- Presence System: See which users are currently online.

üîê Security Model
The security of StegaCrypt Chat is its most important feature, based on two client-side principles:
1. End-to-End Encryption: Using a combination of Caesar Cipher shifts and a Vigen√®re Cipher, a multi-layered encryption key is generated on the client-side for each message. This ensures that the message content stored in the database is completely unreadable without the specific keys, which are only ever held by the clients in the chat.
2. Steganography: As an alternative sending method, the fully encrypted ciphertext is embedded into the pixel data of a randomly chosen cover image. The application then uploads this image. To other users, it appears as a simple image transfer, while authorized clients can extract and decrypt the hidden message, providing plausible deniability. The cover image itself is never displayed in the chat.
